            <p>Hello and welcome to my webpage! As you can see from the teal heading above, my name is Mark.</p>

            <p>When I am not making ground-breaking websites, you can find me at my job where I work with international
              college students assisting them with their immigration needs and giving them academic advice. When I am
              not at work, you can find me either rock climbing or training for rock climbing. When I am not rock
              climbing or training for rock climbing, you can find me making energy bars for my (very very very) small
              company. When I am not making energy bars, you can find me at my friend’s woodshop where I am learning to
              turn wood on lathes to make bowls. These activities took place in a much higher frequency before I began
              the UW Coding Bootcamp. Now my time mostly consists of a furrowed-brow gazing toward a computer screen,
              forehead in hand, while feverishly clicking boxes in Chrome Inspector trying to figure out why my content
              won’t align.</p>

            <p>Now that you know me better, please check out my portfolio page which I am sure will blow your mind. I
              recommend sitting down before clicking the link because the sheer awe of it may make your knees buckle. I
              apologize in advance.</p>
